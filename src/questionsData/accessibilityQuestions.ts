    question: "What is web accessibility?",
    answer:
      "Web accessibility means making websites, tools, and technologies designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. It includes measures like using alt tags for images and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to improve access for assistive technologies.",
  },
  {
    id: 7002,
    question: "Why is web accessibility important?",
    answer:
      "Web accessibility is important because it ensures equal access and opportunity for people with disabilities. It enables them to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and web applications effectively. Web accessibility also benefits everyone by improving usability, search engine optimization, and overall user experience.",
  },
  {
    id: 7003,
    question: "What are some common accessibility barriers on the web?",
    answer:
      "Some common accessibility barriers on the web include inaccessible forms, missing alt text for images, lack of proper heading structure, inadequate color contrast, absence of keyboard navigation support, and inaccessible multimedia content.",
  },
  {
    id: 7004,
    question: "How can color contrast be improved for better accessibility?",
    answer:
      "Color contrast can be improved by ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide specific contrast ratio requirements for different text sizes and font weights. Tools like color contrast checkers can help evaluate and adjust color combinations for better accessibility.",
  },
  {
    id: 7005,
    question: "What is the purpose of alt text in images?",
    answer:
      "Alt text, or alternative text, is used to describe the content of an image when it cannot be displayed. It is important for accessibility because screen readers can read the alt text aloud, providing users with visual impairments with a description of the image's content and context.",
  },
  {
    id: 7006,
    question: "What are ARIA attributes and how are they used?",
    answer:
      "ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are used to enhance the accessibility of dynamic web content and web applications. They provide additional information to assistive technologies about the roles, states, and properties of elements on a web page. ARIA attributes can be added to HTML elements to make them more accessible, such as indicating navigation menus, form inputs, and dynamic content updates.",
  },
  {
    id: 7007,
    question: "How can keyboard accessibility be ensured?",
    answer:
      "Keyboard accessibility can be ensured by ensuring that all interactive elements on a web page can be accessed and operated using only the keyboard. This includes providing keyboard focus indicators, handling keyboard events correctly, and ensuring logical tab order through the content. It allows people who cannot use a mouse or other pointing device to navigate and interact with the website.",
  },
  {
    id: 7008,
    question: "What is the purpose of semantic HTML?",
    answer:
      "Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that convey meaning and structure to both humans and assistive technologies. By using appropriate semantic elements like <nav>, <header>, <main>, <section>, and <article>, the content becomes more understandable and navigable for users with disabilities and improves overall accessibility.",
  },
  {
    id: 7009,
    question: "How can form accessibility be improved?",
    answer:
      "Form accessibility can be improved by providing clear and descriptive labels for form controls, associating labels with their respective input fields using the 'for' attribute, providing meaningful error messages, and ensuring proper keyboard navigation and focus management within the form.",
  },
  {
    id: 7010,
    question: "What is skip navigation and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "Skip navigation is a technique that allows users to bypass repetitive navigation links and jump directly to the main content of a web page. It is important for accessibility because it saves time and effort for screen reader users who frequently navigate through the same navigation links on multiple pages, allowing them to quickly access the primary content.",
